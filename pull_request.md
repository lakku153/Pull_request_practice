What is a Pull Request?
## A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another in a GitHub repository. It is commonly used in collaborative development, especially in open-source projects and team workflows.

Key Aspects of a Pull Request:

Proposes Changes: It allows developers to propose changes before merging them into the main branch.
Code Review: Other contributors or maintainers can review, comment, and approve the changes.
Testing & Discussion: Automated tests and discussions ensure the changes are appropriate before merging.
Version Control: Helps maintain a structured development workflow by tracking and documenting code changes.
